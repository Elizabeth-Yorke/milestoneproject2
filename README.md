# Maths Lines

Welcome to Maths Lines. This is an interactive maths game. Each icon hides a maths question. To win the game, you need to answer four questions in a straight line correctly. Click on a circle to reveal your first question.

A live version of the site can be viewed from [here.](https://elizabeth-yorke.github.io/SusieJunes-A/)

Here is a mock-up image of Maths Lines interactive game, using the "Am I Responsive" site.

## UX



### Wireframes

My wireframe was created using Balsamiq.
Here are screenshots of the wireframes:

| Page | Phone Wireframe | Tablet Wireframe | Desktop Wireframe |

| Game | [phone](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) | [tablet](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) | [desktop](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) | 
| Instructions | [phone](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) | [tablet](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) | [desktop](assets/documentation/wireframes/TBC) |

### Colour Scheme

I used the UX Design section of Adobe Color [https://color.adobe.com/trends/Ui/ux] to identify the most current user friendly colour palates available. I also looked at their game design section of Adobe Colour [https://color.adobe.com/trends/Game-design]. I noticed that there was an abundance of purple based themes in both sections, so I chose a purple based colour palate. I then checked this palate using WebAIM contrast checker [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/], and made the shades lighter and darker to ensure I had a colour scheme that included a number of high contrast pairings. The palate was created by Adobe Colour and contained the following colours:

#B6E7F5 - pale teal
#54AFC7 - mid teal (not to be written on directly due to contrast issues)
#084A5C - dark teal
#1F0229 - dark purple
#E8C4F5 - pale purple

### Fonts

I selected the fonts for this project from Google Fonts.

Having looked at a number of quiz type phone games, I decided that the title font should be a bit different, to catch the eye of the user. I chose the **Luckiest Guy** font.

The font used for the numbers needs to be really clear to read, but still eyecatching. The numbers should look as interesting as possible, whilst maintaining clarity. I chose **Kaushan Script** for this purpose.

On the other hand, the font used for the explanation needs to be very easy to read, or users won't bother to read it! I chose **Quicksand** for this purpose.

Whilst looking through fonts, I discovered **Noto Color Emoji** font, which I decided to use for my game graphics.
